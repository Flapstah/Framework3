CVars
	need a way to register const vars (i.e. declared const as opposed to just flagged const)

Utility
	uber header for stdafx.h

Configuration
	Maybe consolidate config file and options into a single, searchable configuration?
		might not be practical but worth investigating

Engine
	Need to revisit versioning since debug builds now don't bump the version (generate_version dependencies)

Unit tests
	probably can do nicer comparisons of strings in cvar tests now that we're using std::string
	Need to add custom log unit test
	Make unit test exe delete/create results file so that the main executable will fail to build if the unit tests fail

Tracing
	Could store callstack address of function in the trace macro?  Might help with debugging..?
		Requires being able to grab the callstack

File system
	Need to handle virtual file system (mount archive (zip?) files as directories)

Solved/fixed:
	Need file system abstraction to control the number of open files (use boost::filesystem under the hood)
		Just made a utility class in the end to wrap common functionality - how many files would I be managing anyway?
		Need to factor out storage of root directory to internal filesystem class
	Nev pointed out that CUnitTest::AddStage is poorly named - should be AddTest
	Logs no longer being elided from code when in release builds - why?
		To do with not being able to determine the value of log_level as a constant at runtime
			Release builds now expose log_level as a static constant in log.h
		Once engine lifecycle management is in place, can register log level as debug cvar
		Log to file still needs implementing
	Seem to have a circular dependency for engine/independent/common/version.cpp
		Needed to remove the full path (i.e. path needed ${test_SOURCE_DIR}) of version.cpp
	Also have some smart pointer warnings in release builds
		Boost include directories now treated as system directories (include_directories(SYSTEM xxx) means use -isystem instead of -I with gcc make)
	Now that there is separation by library, need separation by namespace
		Removed interface based design
			No need for pure interfaces in static libraries or monolithic executables - it's a better fit for dynamic libraries
				Dynamic libraries mean all code (whether used or not) is available, and you pay the virtual dereference cost for interfaces
	Make FPS calculations a separate class so that timers can have their own FPS calculator (engine can run at very high fps, but e.g. renderer is locked to ~60fps)
	Working on argument parsing
		Need a generic, data driven way to parse command line (and preferably config files too)
	use a cvar for the default log flags (that way it can be overridden on either the command line or by config file)
