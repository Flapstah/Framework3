Project
	Seperate VS filters for files

Unit tests
	Need to add custom log unit test
	Make unit test exe delete/create results file so that the main executable will fail to build if the unit tests fail

Logs
	Unit tests can use a unit test log that hangs off the master log, and turn off the engine log whilst running the tests
