Unit tests
	cvar unit test works fine under mingw32, but not for VS built exe - investigate (need to test on linux too)
	probably can do nicer comparisons of strings in cvar tests now that we're using std::string
	Need to add custom log unit test
	Make unit test exe delete/create results file so that the main executable will fail to build if the unit tests fail

Logs
	Log to file still needs implementing
